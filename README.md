# Weather-or-not

Whether or not you're going to be outdoors, it's always nice to know the weather! Welcome to my weather checker app; thank you very much for taking the time to check out my page and may the sun shine brightly upon your smiling face!

The api calls to populate the weather for the various elements are done using openweathermap.org's free api, and the date elements use moment.js library. In terms of the coding process for this app, the only really difficult part was realizing that I could nest ajax calls into other ajax calls; and could therefore use variables obtained during the first api call in the second one (for UVI).

Remember to wear sunscreen if the UVI is high and don't forget to bring a towel!
